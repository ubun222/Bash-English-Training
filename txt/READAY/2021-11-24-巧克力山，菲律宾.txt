                巧克力山，菲律宾
  每年11月下旬开始的旱季，覆盖在菲律宾保和省滚动的圆锥形土丘上的绿草开始变成棕色，把这一地区变成了一望无际的一排排巧克力山。正因为如此，巧克力山成为了一个旅游景点。省政府甚至在距地区首府Tagbilaran约50公里的小镇Carmen建了一个观景中心。

  In late November, the dry season arrives in the Bohol province of the Philippines to create a magical confection: The green grass that covers these rolling, conical mounds begins to turn brown, transforming the area into what looks like endless hills of chocolate. At least 1,260 of these 'Chocolate Hills' are spread across about 20 square miles. The unusual landscape has become a robust tourist attraction, leading the regional government to construct a viewing complex amidst the hills in the town of Carmen.
  Local legends tell several different origin stories for the hills. One suggests they're leftover wreckage following a battle between two giants. Another says they were formed by the tears of a heartbroken giant. Geologists offer a different story: The hills are a kind of cockpit karst—marine limestone deposits that were uplifted millions of years ago, then slowly eroded by wind and water.

11 月下旬，菲律宾保和省进入旱季，制作出一种神奇的甜点：覆盖这些连绵起伏的圆锥形土丘的绿草开始变成棕色，使该地区变成看起来像无尽的巧克力丘陵。这些“巧克力山”中至少有 1,260 个分布在大约 20 平方英里的范围内。不寻常的景观已成为一个强大的旅游景点，导致当地政府在卡门镇的群山中建造了一个观景综合体。
  当地传说讲述了几个不同的山丘起源故事。有人认为它们是两个巨人之间战斗后留下的残骸。另一个说它们是由一个伤心欲绝的巨人的眼泪形成的。地质学家提供了一个不同的故事：山丘是一种驾驶舱喀斯特——数百万年前被隆起的海洋石灰岩沉积物，然后被风和水慢慢侵蚀。
